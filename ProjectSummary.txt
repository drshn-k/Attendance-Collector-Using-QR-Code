In this project we are going to design and make a QR Code and Barcode scanner. We will also design a web app for interacting and collecting this data. This scanner will help us to scan QR codes with which we will be able to collect persons data. In our specific use case, we are going to collect data for excel sheet generation of attendance of students in school and college. But this project is not just limited to schools and colleges but also can be used in big software companies and other institutions like government offices for east generation and collection of data like total hours worked, person presence etc, which will increase the efficiency of our work as false data or proxies will be eliminated.

The most important part in our project will be our scanner or camera through which we can scan the QR codes or barcodes. The scanner will then scan and transfer the data to our system with which our system will generate reports in Excel sheet. The JSON data will be passed from the scanner and exported to a Excel sheet. This Excel sheet can easily be customized according to user requirements.

The front end or UI of our project will be designed in figma. It will be a simple UI with which we will be able to interact with our system in an easy way. The backbone of our system which is the data processing will be done in Node.js. Various modules of Node.js will be used which will make our project easy to make and faster. For connection of our frontend with backend we will use MongoDB.
